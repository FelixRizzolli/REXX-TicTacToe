# REXX-TicTacToe
TicTacToe is a paper-and-pencil Game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

## Gameplay
### Theory
In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

### REXX UI for TicTacToe
The playing field looks like this:
```
   EMPTY         X-WON         O-WON         DRAW
   !   !       X ! O !       X !   ! O     X ! O ! X
-----------   -----------   -----------   -----------
   !   !       O ! X !       X ! O ! X     X ! O ! X
-----------   -----------   -----------   -----------
   !   !       O ! X ! X     O ! X ! O     O ! X ! O
```
The player in turn must enter the coordinates on which he wants to place his mark as follows:
```
XSY
```
`X` = X coordinate = 1, 2 or 3

`S` = separator = one character

`Y` = Y coordinate = 1, 2 or 3
